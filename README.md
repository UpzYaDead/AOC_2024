### 🎯 **Notes**
- Each puzzle folder (e.g., `day1/`, `day2/`) contains the **solution and input files**.
- Execution time is not included in this table but can be analyzed with performance logs.
- Difficulty is subjective but based on problem-solving complexity and algorithmic depth.

This should give your README a **polished, professional**, and **well-structured** look while keeping things **readable and informative**.  

Would you like me to generate a Python script that automatically updates this table as you complete more days? 🚀
