## Notes for Future Years

### **Things I would do differently:**
- When modifying values in a grid, build in **checks for elements that shouldn't be changed**.  
  - Example: Count the number of elements that should remain the same before and after the simulation.  
  - This would have saved me a lot of time in **Day 15 Part 2**!  
- When parsing data into a grid, **use `map()` and `list()`** to make the code **more concise** while maintaining **readability**.

### **Tips for next years:**
- **Practice recursion problems**.  
- **Rewrite** difficult problems after seeing **smarter/easier** solution methods.  
- **Debug visually** when working with grids (print intermediate steps!).
